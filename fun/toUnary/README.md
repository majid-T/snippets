# Code to Unary
This code will receive a value and converts it to unary value.

## Unary value
The unary value does not includes 1,0 as values. It is all same values like 0 and the actuall value is defined based on number of 0s.
### Example:
A charachter in binary would be 01000001.
A charachter in unary would be 0 0 00 00000 0 0.
